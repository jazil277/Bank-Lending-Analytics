## Comprehensive Credit Risk Analysis and Bank Lending Optimization

Assignment Description:
The assignment, "Comprehensive Credit Risk Analysis and Bank Lending Optimization," involves an in-depth analysis of credit risk using real-world borrower and economic data. The project focuses on assessing the probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD), and calculating expected losses over time to evaluate the financial stability of borrowers and the risk exposure of a lending institution. By modeling key variables such as income, loan-to-value ratios (LTV), and FICO scores, the assignment aims to provide insights into borrower creditworthiness, loan performance, and the potential recovery rates for lenders in case of defaults. It also explores how banks can optimize capital allocation and design loan contracts to mitigate financial risks.

Purpose of the Project:
The purpose of this project is to evaluate and model the credit risk associated with lending activities using advanced data analytics. The project aims to assist lenders in making informed decisions regarding loan approvals, creditworthiness assessments, and capital allocation. It focuses on understanding and predicting the risk of loan defaults, potential losses, and the necessary capital required to mitigate such risks. Additionally, the project examines how different economic factors, borrower characteristics, and regulatory frameworks influence lending decisions and risk management strategies.

Objectives of the project:
1. Data Processing and Creditworthiness Analysis:
- Clean and preprocess lending data to identify relevant borrower attributes (such as income, loan-to-value ratios, and FICO scores).
- Analyze borrower income levels and other financial indicators to assess creditworthiness and predict default risk.
  
2. PD (Probability of Default) Modeling:
- Build models to estimate the probability of default (PD) over time based on borrower characteristics and macroeconomic variables.
- Compare different models to evaluate their accuracy and explanatory power in predicting default probabilities.

3. LGD (Loss Given Default) Modeling:
- Develop models to estimate potential losses in the event of default by analyzing factors such as loan-to-value ratios, borrower credit scores, and regional economic conditions.
- Evaluate how income and other features influence LGD and provide insights into loss mitigation strategies for lenders.

4. Expected Loss Calculation:
- Calculate the expected loss percentage over various time periods based on PD and LGD models.
- Analyze patterns of expected loss to understand fluctuations in default risk and recovery rates.

5. Bank Capital Allocation:
- Assess capital adequacy by analyzing Basel capital ratios over time and identify trends in a bank's ability to absorb losses.
- Provide insights into how fluctuations in capital ratios reflect a bank's financial stability and resilience against potential losses.

6. Loan Contracting under IFRS 9 vs. US GAAP:
- Compare the loan loss provisioning frameworks of IFRS 9 and US GAAP, focusing on timing of recognition, measurement, reversals, and impairment triggers.
- Suggest modifications to loan contracts based on future income changes at the state level, such as introducing variable interest rates tied to economic indicators
